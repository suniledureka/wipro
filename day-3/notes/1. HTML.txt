HTML
====
- Hyper Text Markup Language 

- developed by Tim Berners Lee in 1991

- HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language 

- Markup is the process of giving some extra features to a normal text

- A markup language is a set of markup tags 

- An HTML document is called as a web page.

- A web site is a collection of web pages

- An HTML document is saved with the extension of .html (or) .htm

The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and display them as web pages.

HTML Document Structure:
------------------------

An HTML document has got two sections:

(1) Header Section 
  <head>		
    .......
  </head>

It is used to provide general information about the web page like:
> title for the web page

> to provide favicon
etc

(2) Body Section 
 <body>
  .......
 </body>

- used to specify the visible page content, which will be displayed in the document region of the browser

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
	
 </head>
	
 <body>

 </body>
</html>


The <!DOCTYPE> declaration
--------------------------
- it defines the document type to be HTML.
- it is not an HTML tag.
- it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

<!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5  is:
    <!DOCTYPE html>


HTML Heading Tags

Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags and are paired tags. 

<h1> - It is used to create first level heading or main heading
  <h1>heading here</h1>

<h3> 
<h4>
<h5>
<h6> - Least Level Heading

While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading - block elements.

It is a special character (entity) in HTML. 


Centering Content
-----------------
<center> - tag used to put any content in the center of the page or any container

<center>

</center>


- Inline elements takes content width as its own width.
- Block level elements takes parent width as its own width.

<DIV> Tag
---------
- it defines a division or section in an HTML document
- <div> is a container tag and inside that we can add any number of tags
- <div> tag is used with block-level content.
- by default no styles are added to <div>
The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc)

<div> should be used to wrap sections of a document
<span> should be used to wrap a portion of text


- Block level elements:
   - elements that takes parent's width by default
     Eg: <h1>,<p>,...
- Inline element:

Text Formatting Tags
--------------------
HTML Formatting is a process of formatting text for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized, or underlined.

The following HTML tags are used to format the appearance of the text on your web page.

1) Bold Text:

<b>		defines bold text
<strong>	defines strong text
The text in between the tags will be bold, and stand out against text around it, the same as in a word processor.
Note: using <strong> instead of <b>, means you are using Semantic Markup. It is used in Text-to-Speech programs (screen readers)

2) Italics Text:
<i>		defines italic text
<em>		defines emphasized text
italics displays the text at a slight angle.
Used to emphasize text, which usually appears in italics, but can vary according to your browser.

<del>		defines deleted text

4) Underlined Text:
<u>
<ins>		defines inserted text

5) Script Text:
<sub>		defines subscripted text
<sup>		defines superscripted text

6) <mark> 	used for indicating text as marked or highlighted for reference purposes

etc


Computer Output Tags

1) <pre>	Defines preformatted text
Any text between the pre tags, including spaces, carriage returns and punctuation, will appear in the browser as it would in a text editor (normally browsers ignore multiple spaces)


2) <code>	Defines computer code text
Text is displayed in a fixed-width font, commonly used when showing source code

<pre>
 <code>
  int x = 5;
  int y = 6;
  int z = x + y;
  System.out.println("Sum = "+z);
 </code>
</pre> 

3) <kbd>	Defines keyboard text

Citation & Quotations Tags 
--------------------------

1) <abbr>	defines an abbreviation

    Instead of having to set a font size, you can use the small tag to render text slightly smaller than the text around it. Useful for displaying the 'fine-print'.



Ex:
<blockquote>
 Any in-accuracies in this index may be explained by the fact that it has been sorted with the help of a computer.<br>
   from <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite> by Donald Knuth
</blockquote>

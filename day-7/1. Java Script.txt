Java Script
===========
JavaScript is a light weight, scripting and an interpreted programming language with Object Oriented capabilities

JavaScript is used to make interactive web sites

JavaScript works in all browsers.

JavaScript can react to events 

JavaScript can read and write HTML elements 

JavaScript can be used to validate data in the client side. (Client side Validation)

Started : 1995  |  Brendan Eich

Why Java Script?
----------------
Using java script , we can develop:

1) client side applications-
   Single Page Applications (SPA), 
   Angular JS, React JS, Backbone JS etc

2) server side applications
   Node.js, Express.js etc

3) browser extensions
   Blocker for Chrome, 
   Eye Dropper
   Color Zilla etc

4) desktop applications
   Web Torrent Desktop,
   Wordpress Desktop etc
   ElectronJS

5) mobile applications
  Phone GAP, Cordova, Titanium, jQuery Mobile etc

6) Databases
    MongoDB, Firebase etc

7) IoT (Internet Of Things) applications
- JS is the top programming language used for building IOT applications

8) Machine Learning
   -Tensorflow

etc
-----------------------------------------
Java Script Engine

 Firefox : Spider Monkey
 Chrome  : V8 Engine
 IE      : Chakra
 Safari  : Nitro Engine
 etc

-----------------------------------------
- JavaScript can be inline
- Java Script can be internal
- Java Script can be external


Warning for Non-JavaScript Enabled Browsers
------------------------------------
If Java Script is not enabled in the browser, then we can display a warning message to the user using <noscript> tag



Console Object
--------------
"console" object provides access to the browser's debugging console

The console is for testing/debugging purposes.

Press F12 to view the console of browser

console.info(message) -writes an informational message to the console.

console.log(message) - writes a message to the console.

console.error(..) - outputs an error message to the console

console.warn(..) - outputs a warning message to the console

console.debug(..) - check in Firefox browser

console.clear() - to clear the console



JavaScript Variable
-------------------
A variable is a container to store data. 

Variable Naming Rules:
----------------------
1) A variable name can have alpha-numeric characters(A-Z,a-z,0-9) , underscore(_) or dollar symbol ($)

2) A variable name should start with a letter or _ or $ symbol

3) No space is allowed between the characters of a variable name

4) A variable name should not be a reserved keyword of Java Script

5) Variable names are case sensitive    

6) A Java Script variable is declared by using the script "var" or "let"

Examples:
 var firstName;
 let last_name;
 let _age;
 var _$_;

var firstName="Sunil";
console.log(firstName);


Java Script Data Types
----------------------
Following are the data types in JavaScript. 

1. String: Represents textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes (e.g., "hello", 'world').
2. Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14).
3. BigInt: Represents integers of arbitrary precision, exceeding the limits of the Number type (e.g., 9007199254740992n).
4. Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.
5. Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value. -- object type
6. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. 
7. Symbol: Represents unique and immutable values, often used as object keys 
8. Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, used for more complex data structures. Arrays and functions are special types of objects.
Function

Java Script have dynamic typing feature- means that we do not have to define the data type of a variable. 

JS automatically finds the type of the variable , based on how it is set
let n = 25; - type of n is "number"

'typeof' operator is used to get the data type of a variable

typeof n
  OR
typeof(n)


Difference between undefined and null
-------------------------------------
"undefined" means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. 

"null" is a value assigned to a variable, as a representation of no value. 

"undefined" and "null" are two different types: 
undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object type.



JavaScript Operators
--------------------
Operators are used to perform some operations on data. 

Operators are broadly classified into 3 categories:

(a) Unary Operators - only one operand
	n++
(b) Binary Operators - two operands
	a + b
(c) Ternary Operator

Different type of operators in Java Script are:


1) Arithmetic Operators
2) Increment & Decrement Operators
3) Relation/Comparison Operators
	Note:  == will check only for the content, not for the data type where as === will check for the content and also for the type

4)  Logical Operators - used for framing a compound condition
5)  Assignment Operators
6) Conditional/ Ternary Operator
7) String or Concatenation Operator
8) Boolean Complement Operator	
9) Bitwise Operators
10) Shift Operators

11) JavaScript Special Operators

(a) , -	comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement.

(b) delete - deletes a property from the object.

(c) in	- checks if object has the given property

(d) instanceof  - checks if the object is an instance of given type

(e) new	- creates an instance (object)

(f) typeof - checks the data type of variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Condition Statements
--------------------

 - if statement
 - else statement

Control Statements / Loops
--------------------------
1) while
2) do ... while
3) for
4) for-in loop - used to iterate the properties of an object/array.
5) for-of loop - used to iterate the properties of an object/array.
